Now the diagram should render correctly. The Employee ID federation strategy is one of the most robust approaches for enterprise SSO because:

## Key Benefits in Practice

**Operational Stability**: Employee IDs don't change when:
- People get married (name changes)
- Email addresses are reorganized  
- Usernames are modified
- Departments are restructured

**Cross-System Consistency**: The same Employee ID works across:
- Payroll systems
- Badge access systems
- Active Directory
- Salesforce
- Other enterprise applications

**Audit Trail**: Easy to trace authentication events back to specific employees through HR records

## Real-World Implementation Tips

**Data Loading Strategy**:
```sql
-- Bulk update existing users with Employee IDs
UPDATE User SET FederationIdentifier = EmployeeID__c 
WHERE EmployeeID__c != null AND FederationIdentifier = null
```

**PingFederate Attribute Transformation**:
- Ensure Employee ID format consistency (leading zeros, prefixes)
- Handle edge cases like contractors or temporary workers
- Map additional HR attributes for JIT provisioning

**Monitoring & Troubleshooting**:
- Set up alerts for authentication failures due to missing Federation IDs
- Regular audits to ensure Employee ID sync between HR → AD → Salesforce
- Test user lifecycle scenarios (onboarding, transfers, terminations)

This approach solves the classic enterprise SSO challenge of maintaining stable user identity across multiple systems while supporting organizational changes over time.
