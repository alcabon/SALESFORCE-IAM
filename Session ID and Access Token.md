Great question! While Session ID and Access Token both authenticate API calls, they have several key differences:

## **How They're Obtained**
- **Session ID**: Created through direct username/password authentication via SOAP login() API or web UI login
- **Access Token**: Obtained through OAuth flows (Web Server, User Agent, etc.) which involve user consent and authorization

## **Security Model**
- **Session ID**: Direct credential-based authentication - represents a user session
- **Access Token**: OAuth-based authorization - represents granted permissions with user consent

## **Scope and Permissions**
- **Session ID**: Full access to everything the user can do (inherits all user permissions)
- **Access Token**: Limited by OAuth scopes requested during authorization (can be restricted to specific operations)

## **Lifecycle Management**
- **Session ID**: Tied to login session, expires based on session timeout settings
- **Access Token**: Has defined expiration time, can be refreshed using Refresh Token without re-authentication

## **Use Cases**
- **Session ID**: 
  - Server-to-server integrations with stored credentials
  - Applications that need full user access
  - Legacy integrations
- **Access Token**:
  - Third-party applications requiring user consent
  - Mobile applications
  - Applications needing limited scope access
  - Modern OAuth-compliant integrations

## **Revocation**
- **Session ID**: Revoked when user logs out or session expires
- **Access Token**: Can be revoked independently without affecting user's main session

**Bottom line**: Access Tokens provide more granular security control and are the modern standard, while Session IDs offer simpler but broader access patterns.
